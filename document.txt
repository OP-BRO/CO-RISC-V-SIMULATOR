We had made the whole project togather on google meet , whereas abhay take care of .data section and memory allocation, me Raunak worked on .text and registers , which each other's help
our program is fully comment for easier understanding and it ignores comment in risc code also

make sure before run the riscv code change its path in our main program with "//" instead of "/".

we made (add, addi, sub, subi, li, bne, bge, ble, bgt, blt, beq, sw or sb, lw or lb, j ,jal , move or mv)

our simulator works completly fine with program with these above instruction

our progrom doesn't show user a error what they did wrong (error handling) and it read one instruction per line ,

we working on input and output from the user while runing the code but we unable made any print or input instructions 

 At firist we tried to make method  of each register but failed , now we made an array 
of register name and prallel array of register value , which is working fine
 
we had a hard time in jump ("j","lw","sw") instrustion and  but we succeeded
